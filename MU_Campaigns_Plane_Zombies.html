   <h2>Plane Jumping Zombies</h2>
   <p>So you want to run a zombie game? Have your players running scared from a massive horde of undead. A true survival game where anything can kill you.</p> 
    <h3>The normal zombie game focuses on...</h3>
   <ul>
   		<li> Zombies. Zombies everywhere! </li>
   		<li> Survival. Players are going to have to scrounge for supplies. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>I really wanted to make my player characters afraid for thier lives during this game so I did a few new things with them I have never tried before.</p> 
   <h3>New concepts I introduced to my group. </h3>
   		<p><em>Note- These might not be new to you, but the group I ran this with had never done anything like this. </em></p>
   
 		<ol>
 			<li> Music- Starting with music to get them into the right mood for the game.  </li>
			<li> Level Zero- Players are not adventurers to start with.</li>
			<li> Sanity- You have to worry about going insane as much as the zombies. </li>
			<li> Virus Zombies- Not a new idea, but normal D&amp;D Zombies are brought to life by magic. </li>
  			<li> Plane Jumping- As in, there are multiple planes of existence. More on this later though.  </li>
   		</ol>
   		
   <h3>Music</h3>
   <p>Players show up to a game with all this energy and can be really loud at times. To set the right tone for my games I usually let them get thier chit chat out of the way right away. It delays the start of the game, but when they finally are ready to play they are in the right mood for what's coming. When they finally finish talking and start pulling out their character sheets and dice I play them this song.  </p>

<h3>Level Zero</h3>
   <p>We started at level Zero. What? Never heard of it? Well let me explain then. The main characters in horror type zombie movies deal with regular people fighting zombies. Starting as adventurers gives the players a whole arsenal of abilities that would make surviving a zombie apocalypse a lot easier. Let’s just use our flying spell to fly over the zombie hoard! Not with level zero. Normal character creation has players pick a race, class, and choose a background. <strong>With level zero you just pick a race and background.</strong> . Wait though how do you do your stats for your character? I just used the commoner monster as the base for everyone and add your race and background bonuses as normal. When players hit level 1 then give them there normal stats, but class choices though will be limited. More on that later.  </p>
   <p> By starting at level zero players will start the game as regular people doing regular things, like running a business(remember those backgrounds they made?). Make them play through a few days as normal people first. Let them get to know their neighbors they live by. This requires a lot of prep to make many npc's that are all unique, but it pays off. When the zombie apocalypse hits you get to describe all these neighbors and dear friends dying all around them which will really impact their characters. The face you see on your players when you describe the little girl they would always see playing in the street is now a zombie is just priceless. It also impacts there sanity.  </p>
   <h3> Sanity </h3>
   <p>During the early stages of the game player’s characters will experience a lot of things that are shocking and world changing for them. Which is why I incorporated sanity. I made my own rules for this, but the basics are as follows.</p>
   <p>Players will role a seventh score for sanity. This score would determine their ability to deal with major shocking events. Their score will affect sanity saving throws and their sanity health. Sanity health is equal to 10 plus sanity ability modifier. So sanity health only ever increases when their ability score increases.  </p>
   <p>For example- The players run into the zombie little girl they would always see playing in the street. How could such an innocent little girl now be a zombie? Role a sanity saving throw. On a pass, they deal with it well, nothing happens let the players continue normally. On a fail, they lose 1 sanity health. When the players finally get a break from the zombies and get to rest if they lost sanity health have them role on the short-term madness table in the dungeons master guide to see how they cope with everything they just witnessed.  </p>
   <p>Not everything is going to call for sanity checks. It will mostly be used for big things like...</p>
   <ul>
   		<li> Friends and family dying or turned into zombies </li>
   		<li> Another player dying or being turned into a zombie </li>
   		<li> Having to kill your zombie friend. Players usually will help each other so they don't have to kill them by themselves, but it is not always an option. There are also times when players feel like it’s their duty to kill a friend whose turned, paladins and clerics usually, don't penalize them for this if it fits their character.</li>
   		<li> Learning that the zombie virus has mutated </li>
   		<li> Plane jumping </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Players first time... </p>
   <ul>
   		<li> Time being bitten </li>
   		<li> Being backstabbed by close friends </li>  	
   </ul>
   <h4>Healing Sanity Damage</h4> 
   <p>Only a few things can help heal sanity damage. </p> 
   <ul>
   		<li> Saving those who cannot save themselves. Once per level. </li>
   		<li> Find a new way to combat the zombies. </li>
   		<li> Leveling up, heals 1 sanity damage. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Usually only low level characters should worry about sanity. They will get to a point where they are veteran’s at dealing with craziness.  </p>
   <h3> Virus Zombies </h3>
   <p>Normal D&amp;D Zombies are brought to life by magic. Usually controlled by necromancers to be a real threat. Virus zombies make players very weary of close combat, but they can't always escape it. 
 </p>
   <p>Getting instantly turned when you get bitten doesn't work well in a game where people get attached to their characters. So, we make it so that the virus takes 12 hours to a day to turn you into a zombie. 
 </p>
   <h3> Plane Jumping </h3>
   <p>By making the borders between the planes thin and overlapping it allows the players to plane jump at low level. Do a role every month in game to see if your players plane jump cause of this natural overlapping of the planes. You can have them go to the under dark, or the Fey Wild. But I wanted to have them run into their favorite characters from television, movies, and games they watched and played. It is interesting to watch Zombie Shrek and Donkey chase the players down. Or see them fight side by side with Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn at the battle of Helms Deep against zombie orcs. After introducing them to the Plane jumping I devised a list of television, movies, and games that they wanted to visit on their zombie apocalypse adventure. 
  </p>
  
   
   <h3>Leveling up to 1</h3>
   <p>During level zero players must save their friends, family, and community. At the end of level zero they are either holed up somewhere or on the run. So, what do you do to level up? Generate the rest of the ability scores as normal, but picking a class will be different. During level zero as they try to save their friends, family and community members they will also have the option of saving trained individuals. It will be risky to save them all so have them choose who to save. They can then only pick classes that one of the survivors they saved have. If nobody saved a priest then there is no cleric or paladin. This makes their choices very important. Not all classes need special training though, such as Warlocks, 'Wild magic' Sorcerers, Fighters with the 'Champion' archetype. You can also be lenient about this, or introduce a new npc right before they level so they have the option for a healer just in case they didn't save a priest.  </p>
     
   <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
   <p>This campaign is very role play heavy and takes a lot of prep work. However, I found this campaign rewarding.  </p>
